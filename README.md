# Recognizer for handwritten formulas
A simple recognizer for handwritten formulas. It should be used on www.visualmath.ru (can still be under construction).

When a student completes the task on a paper he/she should be able to take a photo of the answer and send it to the system. Our recognizer takes the photo and returns LaTex representation of the formula on it (examples in ...).
